The folder contains codes used to generate figures for the ELF3 paper
To generate the figures download all the files. Bifurcation diagrams are plotted by running the elf3_core_plots and WT1_core_plots files.
elf3_core_plots references the core.m, core_bifur.m, elf3.m, el3_bifur.m files.
WT1_core_plots references the WT1, WT1_bifur and WT1_core_plots files.
The dynamics plots are obtained by running the dynamics_script.m and dynamics_script_WT1.m files
